# Optimal mindset ideas

* Make effort to improve yourself and the way you process thing.
* Focus on what you are doing.
* Be where you are.
* Don’t blame something or someone for problems, do your best.
 * When problems occurs, there is not always a problem source, various problems will always occurs, often the best you can do for not being impacted by problem is to not looking at blaming something or someone but to simply do your best to live with.
* Look for continuous improvement:
 * Don’t base your feed-back of yourself on reaching a single point conclusion like:
  * I am appreciate, let’s make no more effort.
  * I am depreciate, let’s bring me down alone.
 * Base your feed-back on yourself progression improvement.
 * For processing → make efforts (try hard) & evaluate effort and progression not result.
 * For organization → avoid effort, problems and obstacles & evaluate the way to result.
* Minimize cost to make efforts and improve results.
* Good efficiency and comportment take effort.
* Think the less to process but when you have a good idea, write it.
