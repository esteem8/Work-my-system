#Strategy principles
##Introduction
An optimal strategy is a strategy that take less cost to accomplish an objective.

Strategy must be realist and composed of directives that can be nested and checked by checkpoints.
* A directive = a process line resumed in a composition of words.
* A checkpoint = a process point that stand after a directive to validate it.

Directives must be optimally allocated within the trajectory to optimally achieve an objective.
* Optimally allocated = not too much directives to loose cost re-planning because of unknown events and too less * to loose cost asking too much what is this fuck.

##Principles
Principles are tools to efficiently define optimal directives.
* Documentation must be clear, simple and up-to-date.
* Documentation provide solid lines, thus draw an exact status of where things stand.
* Think freshly from scratch knowing actual parameters that matters for objective.
* Think the simplest way with a cost-conscious mindset in order to accomplish objective.
* Know what is optimal, what is not and plan the optimal strategy.
* Focus on sustainable cost management, cost reduction and investment.
* Feed-back strategy optimization and check if it is realistic.
* When problems occurs there are gifts to optimize trajectory and get closer to objective.
