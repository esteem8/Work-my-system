#Processing principles

##Introduction
This document provide a set of principles to optimally transform strategy procedures into process.

At the beginning of the workday **optimally choose strategies parts to work on** and transform them into efficient process.

During the workday **process process chosen efficiently** by being in optimal conditions.

##Day process organization principles
* Choose directive parts that is optimal to work on for the workday.
* To optimally choose what to work on use these principles above:
  * See thing with a cost-conscious driven mindset to minimize effort.
  * Do efficiency improvement process first to maximize exchange rate.
  * Increase motivation by knowing doing actual optimal task to achieve the goal.
  * First things first by urgency then importance with knowing strategies deadlines.
* Directive parts chosen must be optimally transformed into tasks.
* Tasks can be time planned, prioritized and sequenced or not.

##Day processing efficiency principles
* Processing perfectly a task mean with the best exchange rate.
* Do whatever it takes to ensure the best efficiency.
  * Don’t let something take the control, have it.
  * Don’t stay in comfort zone, persist in front of obstacles.
  * See each little malfunction like something to improve.
  * Be happy for quick wins and slightly positive.
* Focus on actual process and make effort.
* Do your best, you are the last efficiency parameter.

##Tasks processing problems solving procedure
* Task is too complicated ? → Sub-sequence it.
* Task is blocked by something ? → Find and remove obstacle.
* Obstacle is too difficult to remove ? → Find an other way.
