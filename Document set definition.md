#"Work my system” Document set definition

##Introduction
This document describe the document set needed to get a good organization and efficiency composed of:
* Strategic objective [Unique] 	     → Goal composed of nested objectives.
* [Strategy principles](https://github.com/Primerz/WorkMySystem/blob/master/Principles/Strategy%20principles.md) [Unique] 	     → Principles to efficiently plan optimal strategies.
* Strategic procedures [Multiple]  → Strategies to optimally accomplish objectives.
* [Processing principles](https://github.com/Primerz/WorkMySystem/blob/master/Principles/Processing%20principles.md) [Unique]   → Principles to efficiently process actions from strategies.

##Words explanation
* The goal = the primary objective.
* An objective = an objective eventually composed of nested objectives.
* A principle = a tool to efficiently process a process composed by words.
* A process = a reflexion, a decision or an action.
* Efficiently = with the best power exchange rate.
* An exchange rate = the rate of the result divided by the cost.
* A cost = an effort * a time.
* An effort = a power inputed at a process.
* Optimal = just good enough to get suitable results with the minimal cost.
* To optimize = aka to perfect means to maximize exchange rate.
* A trajectory = a set of process in order to accomplish a specific objective.
* A malfunction = a process or sub-process dysfunction.

##Strategic objectives [Unique]

**What ?** → Chosen goal to achieve composed of nested objectives.

**Such as ?** → Chosen destination to reach composed of intermediate way point.

So this document describe the chosen goal composed of nested objectives.

##Strategy principles [Unique]

**What ?** → Principles to efficiently define optimal strategic procedures.

**Such as ?** → Tools to efficiently plan shortest trajectories. 

So this document is a set of principles to efficiently plan optimal strategic procedures.

##Strategic procedures [Multiple]

**What ?** → Realistic strategies to optimally accomplish objectives.

**Such as ?** → Optimum trajectories to reach way points.

So these are realist and optimal strategies to accomplish objectives in order to achieve the goal.

##Processing principles [Unique]

**What ?** → Principles to optimally process strategic procedures.

**Such as ?** → Best efficiency to follow the trajectory.

So this is a set of tools to day-to-day optimally distribute efforts into strategy procedure parts and transform them into more detailed process in order to process them efficiently with the best conditions and exchange rate.
